# ProxyScanner.NodeJs
This is a proxy IP:Port scanner, for some one can't visit some internet site, like google.com

#For Now:
1. You can download the source, or clone it to folder like: D:/ProxyScanner.NodeJs;
2. open the path in Windows CMD;
3. Excute the command: **node app.js**;
All are done! You will find the valid proxy to visit google.com.hk or google.com.

If you want a proxy to visit some special url, for example: http://www.facebook.com, 
you can add one more argument, like this: **node app.js http://www.facebook.com**.

Here is a link to see how to set proxy(in Windows):
