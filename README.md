# ProxyScanner.NodeJs
This is a proxy IP:Port scanner, for some one can't visit some internet site, like google.com

#For Now:
You can download the source, or clone it to folder like: D:/ProxyScanner.NodeJs, open the path in Windows CMD:
then excute the command: node app.js, All are done! You will find the valid proxy to visit google.com.hk or google.com.

If you want a proxy to visit some special url, for example: http://www.facebook.com, 
you can add one more argument, like this: node app.js http://www.facebook.com .

Enjoy it!

#I will develop a ui for it later.
